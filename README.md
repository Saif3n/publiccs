This repository implements CRUD functionality with the Entity Framework, making use of the MVC software design pattern.

Certain details have been omitted (some are omitted because they are part of projects I have yet to finish). The usage of MD5 to encrypt passwords will change once I implement the endpoint in a public project.

All my endpoints are hosted on a single repository as it simplifies hosting on Microsoft Azure.

Endpoints have been developed/implemented since July 2022.
